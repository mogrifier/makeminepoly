What does this do? This automates the recording a polyphonic MIDI tracks on a Monosynth. This is a great timesaver and can produce really rich tracks from a monosynth.

Take a single polyphonic MIDI track recorded in your favorite DAW.
This software will explode it into multiple tracks- one for each note- and write the new multitrack MIDI file.
The software will play each new MIDI track one at a time on your favorite monosynth and record the audio. 
The software must be configure with the MIDI output port and the audio input channel.

The resulting multiple audio files (currently CD Quality) can be dropped back into your DAW for subsequent editing and use.
